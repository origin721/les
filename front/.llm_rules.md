# LLM Rules for this Project

1.  **Always read this file first:** Before making any changes to the project, please read this file to understand the project-specific guidelines.
2.  **Theme file:** The project uses a theme file located at `front/src/styles/watchdogs.css` which defines the color palette. If you need to add new colors, please extend this file rather than adding colors elsewhere.
